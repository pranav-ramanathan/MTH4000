One mornin
g, when Gregor Samsa 
woke from 
troubled dreams, he found himself transformed in his bed 
into a hor
rible vermin.

He lay on 
his armour-like back, and if he lifted his 
head a lit
tle he could see his brown belly, slightly domed and divided by arches into stiff sections.

The beddin
g was hardly able to cover it and seemed ready to slide off any moment.

His many l
egs, pitifully thin compared with 
the size o
f the rest of him, waved about helplessly as he looked. "What's happened to me? " he thought. It wasn't a dream. His room, a proper 
human room
 although a little too small, lay peacefully between its four familiar walls.
